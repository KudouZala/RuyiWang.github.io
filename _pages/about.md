## 👋 Hello there! I'm **Ruyi Wang (王濡翼)**

> *"Coding is poetry; debugging is war."*

A passionate researcher dedicated to rescuing the **PEM water electrolysis system** from the invisible threat of **ion contamination**.

Academically born and raised at **Tongji University**, where I earned both my **Bachelor's** and **Master's** degrees in the **School of Automotive Studies**.

Currently conducting research under the mentorship of **Prof. Xuezhe Wei**, at the **Electrochemical Digital Power Research Lab**, with a focus on intelligent diagnostics for electrochemical energy systems.

### 🧠 Research Interests
- Intelligent fault diagnosis for **PEM water electrolysis systems**, with a special focus on **ion poisoning detection**
- Cross-domain method transfer between **PEM fuel cells** and **electrolyzers**
- Physics-informed and data-driven approaches for **impedance analysis** and **voltage prediction**

📄 **First-author Publication**  
> **A Review of Portability of Fault Diagnosis Methods from PEM Fuel Cells to PEM Water Electrolyzers**
