## 👋 Hello there! I'm Ruyi Wang

> "Coding is poetry, debugging is war."

A student bravely saving the **PEM water electrolysis system** from the chaos of ion contamination.

Born and raised (academically) at **Tongji University**, where I completed both my undergraduate and master’s studies in the **School of Automotive Studies**.

Currently working under the guidance of **Prof. Xuezhe Wei**, at the **Electrochemical Digital Power Research Lab**.

### 🧠 Research Interests
- Fault diagnosis of PEM water electrolysis systems — especially **ion poisoning detection**
- First-author paper published:  
  **A review of portability of fault diagnosis methods from PEM fuel cells to PEM water electrolyzers**  
  🔗 [Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-025-07318-1)

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python / PyTorch (I'm either debugging or planning to debug)
- Fitting functions, tuning architectures, training models...  
  Only to conclude: "It’s not my fault — it’s physics and chemistry."

---

### 🧪 Currently Working On
- Turning papers from "readable" to "publishable"
- Making models go from "runs" to "actually converges"
