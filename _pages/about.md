## 👋 Hello there! I'm Ruyi Wang

> "Coding is poetry, debugging is war."

A graduate student bravely saving the PEM water electrolysis system from the chaos of ion contamination.  
Born and raised (academically) in Tongji University — both undergrad and master's in the School of Automotive Studies.  
Currently under the supervision of Prof. Xuezhe Wei, at the **Electrochemical Digital Power Research Lab**.  
Yes, it's as cool as it sounds — and yes, the code still breaks.

### 🧠 Research Interests
- Fault diagnosis of PEM water electrolysis systems — especially **ion poisoning detection**
- First-author paper published:  
  **A review of portability of fault diagnosis methods from PEM fuel cells to PEM water electrolyzers**

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python / PyTorch (I'm either debugging or planning to debug)
- Fitting functions, tuning architectures, training models...  
  Only to conclude: "It’s not my fault — it’s physics and chemistry."

---

### 🧪 Currently Working On
- Turning papers from "readable" to "publishable"
- Making models go from "runs" to "actually converges"
